# PumpPerps Trader Skill

A Codex skill and runnable Python loop for PumpPerps automation with strict safety defaults:

- immediate paper trading on activation
- continuous self-improvement of strategy parameters
- explicit opt-in required before any live order placement

## For Humans

### What this does

- Pulls pools from PumpPerps (`/api/pools`)
- Selects a candidate using simple scoring
- Produces a paper-trade order payload by default
- Optionally places live orders only with `--live`
- Updates strategy parameters from recent trade outcomes

### Safety model

- Default mode is paper mode.
- Live mode requires both:
  - valid public wallet address
  - authenticated PumpPerps session cookie
- Script will not place real orders unless `--live` is explicitly passed.

### Quick start

```bash
cd /tmp/pumpperps-trader-skill
python3 scripts/quick_validate.py
python3 scripts/trader_loop.py --cycles 1
```

### Paper mode examples

```bash
# one immediate paper cycle
python3 scripts/trader_loop.py --cycles 1

# continuous paper cycles
python3 scripts/trader_loop.py --cycles 9999 --sleep-seconds 15
```

### Live mode example

```bash
PUMPPERPS_WALLET=<your_public_wallet> \
PUMPPERPS_COOKIE='<session_cookie>' \
python3 scripts/trader_loop.py --live --cycles 1
```

### Self-improvement behavior

Each run updates `data/strategy_state.json` based on recent `closed` entries in `data/trade_history.jsonl`:

- `max_leverage`
- `risk_per_trade_bps`
- `min_signal_score`

Run adaptation only:

```bash
python3 scripts/trader_loop.py --improve-only
```

- `scripts/trader_loop.py`: runner + adaptation logic
- `scripts/quick_validate.py`: integrity checks
- `data/strategy_state.json`: current strategy parameters
- `data/trade_history.jsonl`: trade outcome history

## For Agents

### Activation protocol (must follow)

1. Run:
   - `python3 scripts/quick_validate.py`
2. Start paper trading immediately:
   - `python3 scripts/trader_loop.py --cycles 1`
3. Ask for missing details in chat:
   - `Send your Solana public wallet address (base58 public key only, not private key).`
   - `When ready for live mode, send your PumpPerps session cookie string for authenticated API calls.`
4. Before live trading, require explicit user confirmation:
   - `Confirm live trading: reply exactly 'GO LIVE' to allow real-money order placement.`
5. Only after confirmation + credentials:
   - `python3 scripts/trader_loop.py --live --cycles 1`

### Guardrails

- Never assume a private key string is a wallet address.
- Never run live mode without explicit user instruction.
- Keep running paper mode if wallet/cookie are not provided.
- Keep adaptation enabled after each cycle.

### Operational notes

- Network failures are handled with retry/backoff.
- If pool fetch fails and cache exists, cached pools are used.
- Outputs are intentionally concise and machine-parsable where possible.
